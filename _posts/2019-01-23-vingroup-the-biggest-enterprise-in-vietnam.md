**Shopping!!!** If you have experience to live in Vietnam, I think you must also have shopped in one of these stores.

* `VinMart`: convenience stores
* `VinMart+`: supermarket
* `VinPro`: electronics stores
* `VinDS`: home and beauty stores
* `adayroi.com`: e-commerce

Recently, the VinGroup release the groupcard service called `VinID`. If you use the card to shop in VinGroupâ€™s shops, you can get Vinpoint for a direct deduction on your bill during transaction at the shops. 1 Vinpoint is equal to 1,000 VND
