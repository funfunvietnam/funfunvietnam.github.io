If you live in Hanoi for a period of time, you must know the transportation situation in here. The most popluar vehicle in here is motocycle. For short distance movement is fast and convenient. This advantage does not only belong to local citizen but also to foreigners. Because the Uber likes service in here is also popular. It calls `Grab`, provides taxi, bike, give a ride service.

The service providers ( aka drivers ) for Grab are mass. They own their vehicles and use Grab's platform to receive customer's requirement. So their relationship is partnership. Compare with some of taxi service in here, Grab service is much much trustworthy. Because when a customer use Grab platform to find a taxi service, the fee is decided before matching to the driver. Base on this mechanism, customers no need worry drivers take advantage. Ex: drive a long way to increase the fee.

As a foreign traveler, in my opinion, it is a wise choice to use Grab because of these reasons:

## Available on smartphone

The Grab provide service via mobile App of iOS and Android. Easy to download, and the setting is quick. Because it does not force to bind a credit card. You can pay cash after arriving the destination.

## No Language Barrier

No need to worry about unfamiliar local language. Just follow the app's steps to setting your destination, then the driver will know your requirement.

1. **Book in Just 2 Taps**: Key in your pick-up and drop-off locations to get your estimated fare.
2. **Get a Driver**: Grab will find you the nearest available driver.
3. **Track Your Driver**: Know your driver’s location and estimated time of arrival in real-time.
4. **Arrive Safely**: Share your trip details with loved ones for added safety or even just to let them know you’re on your way.

## Fast Matching

The drives of Grab in Hanoi are mass. It is very fast to find a bike or a taxi. For the bike drivers, they all wear green halmet and shirt, it's very easy to recognize. However, for the car drivers, no color help. But the app will show the car details, include the vehicle identification number, car color, car model number, driver's name, and driver's portrait. These information is very helpful in mass vehicles.
