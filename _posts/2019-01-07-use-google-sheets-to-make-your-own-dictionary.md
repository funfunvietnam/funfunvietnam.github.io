If you have experience to lookup Vietnamese words in English dictionary, you must be noticed that the quality of the translation is often unsatisfied. Let's look deeply in this problem by using two popular dictionaries, `Google Translate` and `English Vietnamese Dictionary TFlat`.

{% include plugins/google-ad-automatic-size.html %}

When we lookup the words, **chﾃｭnh ph盻ｧ** and **chﾃｭnh quy盻］**, both of them are translated as **government**.

In fact, they indicate to different types of government:

`chﾃｭnh ph盻ｧ` means central government.
> ex: the Vietnamese government

`chﾃｭnh quy盻］` means local government.

> ex: the Hanoi government

So, for the learning purpose, record these subtle details, I used Google Sheets to build a dictionary with search function and automatic translate by Google Translate. In addition, I've shared it to public. You can download this template to build your own personal dictionary.
