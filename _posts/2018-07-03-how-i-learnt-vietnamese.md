Last year, I have a plan to travel to Vietnam as a backpacker. It’s my first time to visit this country, so I thought I should learn some Vietnamese. Then, I bought a Vietnamese language book for Chinese beginner.

This book teaches pronunciation and some topics about daily conversation.
After self-studied whole book and its CD, I thought I was able to speak few sentences in some topics:

* Greeting
* Family
* Shopping
* Asking for directions
* Date & Time
* Order in a restaurant
* Simple conversation in Hotel


During this trip, the words I often used are:

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-6">
    <table class="striped">
      <thead>
        <tr><th>For greeting</th></tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr><td>xin chào (for all gender, all age)</td></tr>
        <tr><td>chào anh (for male)</td></tr>
        <tr><td>chào chị (for female)</td></tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-6">
    <table class="striped">
      <thead>
        <tr><th>For shopping / restaurant</th></tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr><td>Bao nhiêu tiền?  (how much is it?)</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Cho tôi cái này.  (give me this)</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Không.  (No)</td></tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
  </div>
</div>

However, the reality is that I cannot use most of what I have just learnt because of the three main problems. The first one is pronunciation. the listener often don’t understand what I said. It noticed me my pronunciation is not accurate. Secondly, the native Vietnamese speaker speak too fast. Apparently, I need more input to practice listening skill. And the finally, some topics is less useful for current era. For example, asking for directions, date & time are easily to be solved by smartphone.

But I still enjoy to communicate with foreigner in their native language. Some vender once hear I use Vietnamese, ask me where am I from and keep up a small talk.
