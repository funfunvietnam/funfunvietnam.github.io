How many airports in Vietnam? Five or six? As a foreigner, I've heard several cities which famous in tourism. For example, H√† N·ªôi, H·ªì Ch√≠ Minh, ƒê√† N·∫µng, H·∫£i Ph√≤ng... So, I think the answer of 5 or 6 might be closed. But the teacher who teach me Vietnamese told me that **Each province has at least one airport**.

According to Wikipedia, *Vietnam is divided into 58 provinces*, so... does that mean there are 58+ airports in Vietnam? For the satisfaction of my curiosity, I decied to find out the answer.

I read two pages of Wikipedia about **List of airports in Vietnam**<a href="#ref-1">[1]</a> and **Provinces of Vietnam**<a href="#ref-1">[2]</a>. Then after orgainzing the information on these pages, I found out the answer of airport amount is very close to my teacher's stand. However, the definition is quite different.

In order to understand the analysis easily, I do some data visualization work as below. Click each buttons on the map or list can show the detail.

To sum up,

* There are 28 provinces has no airports.
* 4 provinces are proposed to build **4** airports.
* 16 provinces has **17** former airports.
* 21 provinces has **23** civil airports.
* 10 provinces has **11** military airports.
* **1** military airport, *Truong Sa Airport*, located at the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea. *so... can't count for any province*

As a result, the total amount of airports in Vietnam is **56** airports.
